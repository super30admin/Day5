## Problem 2:
https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/
Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.
Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Example 1:
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
Note:
You may assume both s and t have the same length.

Approach:

Solution1:
- use 2 hashmaps to maintain character mappings, one for s to t mapping and other for t to s.
- iterate through s and check the s to t and t to s mappings in the 2 hashmaps, if the current characters do not match either of the mappings, return False.
- if there is no mapping, add the mapping to the hashmaps
- at the end of the iteration, return True.

Solution2:
- same as Solution 1 except we use a single hashmap to maintain both the s to t and t to s mappings.
- in order to differentiate between the 2 types of mappings, we add a prefix 's_' and 't_' to s and t character keys respectively. 

Solution3:
- same as solution 1 except we use a hashset instead of a hashmap to maintain t to s mapping.
- if at any point in the iteration, if s to t mapping does not exist but the t to s hashset has the corresponding t character,
  that means it was mapped previously to some other character from s and thus return False.

  
Time Complexity: All 3 solutions take O(n) time.
Space Complexity: All 3 solutions take O(1) space.
