#Time Complexity : O(N), N being the total number letters in array.
#Space Complexity : O(N), because a dictionary was created with the values. 
#Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : Yes
#Any problem you faced while coding this : I had done a similar one previously
#so did not run into as much problems. I did have to search how to add in a set. 
#And I had to change set to tuples to add to dictionary. 

#Your code here along with comments explaining your approach in three sentences only
'''Created a dictionary with key being a unique number representing all the letters
in the word. Then, for each key, place the word in array of values corresponding to the key.
