/**
 * Time Complexity: O(nk) where n is the length of string s and k is the length of pattern 
 * Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of strings
 * 
 * Approach: We maintain 2 hashmaps. One to create character to word mapping,
 * Other mapping for word to character mapping.
 * We iterate over every character in the pattern.
 * If that character is not present in charMap, we add it with value as corresponding word at that index in string s.
 * If that word is not present in wordMap, we add it with value as corresponding char at that index in pattern.
 * If the mapping exists in either map, we compare the value. If it is not equal, we return false.
 * The assumption is that one character should be mapped to one word and vice versa.
