# Explain your approach in **three sentences only** at top of your code :
'''
In this method, we use two hashmapsâ€”one for string s and one for string t. In each hashmap, the key is a character from the 
respective string, and the value is the corresponding character from the other string. For the hashmap of string s, we check 
if a character from s already exists as a key and depending on it verify whether the value associated with that key matches the 
current character from t.
