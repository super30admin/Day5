Isomorphic Strings
"""


class Solution:
    """
    Brute Force Approach:
    In this approach, we determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic by directly comparing their patterns. 
    We identify if the characters in one string consistently map to the corresponding characters in the other string.

    For example:
    - In the strings "foo" and "too":
      - Both have the same pattern: one unique letter followed by two repeated letters.
      - This means the strings are isomorphic.

    Algorithm:
    1. Use two nested loops to iterate through every pair of characters in the strings `s` and `t`.
    2. For each pair of indices `i` and `j`:
       - Check if the pattern between characters in `s` matches the pattern between characters in `t`.
       - Specifically:
         - If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `t[i]` must equal `t[j]`.
         - If `s[i] != s[j]`, then `t[i]` must not equal `t[j]`.
    3. If any discrepancy is found, the strings are not isomorphic, and we return `False`.
    4. If no discrepancies are found after all iterations, return `True`.

    Time Complexity:
    - O(NÂ²), where N is the length of the strings. 
      This is due to the nested loops that compare all pairs of indices.

    Space Complexity:
    - O(1), as no additional data structures are used.

    """
    Optimized Approach:
    To determine if two strings `s` and `t` are isomorphic, we map each character from `s` to `t` and vice versa.
    If at any point the mapping is inconsistent, the strings are not isomorphic.

    Steps:
    1. Use two dictionaries (`smap` and `tmap`) to store the mappings:
       - `smap`: Maps characters from `s` to corresponding characters in `t`.
       - `tmap`: Maps characters from `t` to corresponding characters in `s`.
    2. Traverse both strings simultaneously.
    3. For each character in the strings:
       - Check if the character in `s` has been mapped to a different character in `t`.
       - Check if the character in `t` has been mapped to a different character in `s`.
    4. If any inconsistency is found, return `False`.
    5. If the traversal completes without inconsistencies, return `True`.

    Time Complexity:
    - O(N), where N is the length of the strings `s` and `t`. We traverse both strings once.

    Space Complexity:
    - O(1), as the size of the character set (e.g., ASCII or Unicode) is constant.
