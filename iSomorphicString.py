# Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of chars in the string
# Space Complexity: O(1), since we have 26 alphabets, if we can create an dictionary for 26 letters as key.
# But I created as a dynamic dictionary. is there any other that I can do?
# Did this code successfully run on Leetcode : yes
# Any problem you faced while coding this : No

        # and store the corresponding t value if it is present in the key, we will check, if the value of the key is
        # same as the value of corresponding t position if it is we will continue, other wise we will return false.
        # we will iterate through each word separately with the same conditions.
