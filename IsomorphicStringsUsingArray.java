    Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the strings s and t.
                    The algorithm iterates through each character of both strings once (in the for loop),
                    making it linear with respect to the string length.

    Space complexity: For the array-based approach with a fixed character set (26 lowercase English letters),
                    the space complexity is O(1) because the space used is constant, independent of the
                    length of the input strings.

           The reason we subtract ' ' (ASCII 32) from sChar is because ASCII values of printable characters start from 32 (space).
           Subtracting ' ' ensures that the array indices range from 0 to 94 (which covers all printable characters).

            Example: If sChar = 'e' (ASCII 101), we cannot check sMap[101] that will be ArrayOutOFBounds sp:
            sChar - ' ' = 101 - 32 = 69.
            If this if(sMap[sChar - ' '] !=0) is true, it means that the character sChar from string s has already been mapped to some
            character in t in a previous iteration of the loop.
            If no mapping exists yet, sMap[sChar - ' '] will be 0 (which means no mapping has been assigned yet).

            The default value of a char array in Java is '\u0000', which is the null character with ASCII value 0. This is different
            from the numerical value 0 for integers, but it behaves similarly in that it represents an uninitialized state for
            characters in a char array.
