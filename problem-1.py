# Time Complexity
# O(N*L)
# where N is the number of words and L is the length of each word.
# Space Complexity
# O(n)

# Approach :

# product of primes will always return a unique number
# take each word in the array and based on ascii value find the difference between that char ascii value and ascii of 'a'
# create a prime no array of 26, and assign each character a prime number and calculate its product and that product becomes the key in the hasmap and the word becomes the value
