# Approach:
# 1. Use a dictionary to group words by their sorted version as the key (since anagrams have the same sorted characters).
# 2. Iterate through the input list and append each word to the list corresponding to its sorted key in the dictionary.
# 3. Return the grouped values from the dictionary as the output.

def groupAnagrams(strs):
    anagram_map = {}
    for word in strs:
        sorted_word = ''.join(sorted(word))
        if sorted_word not in anagram_map:
            anagram_map[sorted_word] = []
        anagram_map[sorted_word].append(word)
    return list(anagram_map.values())

# Example usage:
input_array = ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]
print(groupAnagrams(input_array))
